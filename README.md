# NodejsMongoDB_SaveUploadData
In this project Nodejs Express is used to setup the main structure of a simple web application. Feeding some documents 
in Mongodb collection using Nodejs Mongoose package takes place and retriving data and upload them on the main 
webpage.
I will prepare some documentations for doing this project in the next few days for each step and prepare a link to my 
website for those who are interested to follow it step by step.
