# NodejsMongoDB_SaveUploadData
In this project Nodejs Express is used to setup the main structure of a simple web application. Feeding some documents 
in Mongodb collection using Nodejs Mongoose package takes place offline. Retriving data and upload them on the main 
webpage would be the next step to follow.
I will prepare some documentations for doing this project step by step on my website and leave a link here in the next couple of days.
