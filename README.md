# NodejsMongoDB_SaveUploadData
In this project Nodejs Express is used to setup the main structure of a simple web application. There is feeding some documents 
in Mongodb collection using Nodejs Mongoose package and retriving data takes place to upload the saved documents on the main 
webpage.
I will prepare some documentation for doing this project in the next few days for each step and prepare a link to it on my 
website for those who are interested to follow it step by step.
